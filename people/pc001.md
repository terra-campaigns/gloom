### Templar knight

- Tall and thin, rugged long face, sunburnt skin, black hair.

### Life with the Templars

- Religious enforcers, bringing the faith to heretic lands.
- The rituals performed daily dulls the minds of the knights - putting them in the hands of horrific leaders
- Have been tormenting the lives of peasants for years now

### Poorly executed rituals

- Inadvertently loses the trance from the rituals, which goes unnoticed first
- Realisation of the terrible acts of the Templars
- Internal torment starts

### Crossroads

- Decides to desert, but needs to find appropriate moment.
